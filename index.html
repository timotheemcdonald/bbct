        <h2>What is a Virtual World?</h2>
        <div>A Virtual World differs from a traditional game in a few ways. Let's take a look at three main differences. <p>The first is that a Virtual World is persistent over time, and players can affect change to their surroundings - just like the real world! This can be done in different ways depending on the game, such as planting a tree, building a house, or becoming the ruler of a city! </p>The second thing to know, and this is a big difference, is that Virtual Worlds have no <span class="win">win condition</span>. In a traditional game, there is a goal or task that - once completed - a winner is declared and the game ends.</div>
