        <h2 class="title">What is a Virtual World?</h2>
        <div class="centerText">
            A Virtual World differs from a traditional game in a few ways. Let's take a look at three main differences. 
            <div>The first is that a Virtual World is persistent over time, and players can affect change to their surroundings - just like the real world! This can be done in different ways depending on the game, such as planting a tree, building a house, or becoming the ruler of a city! After a user logs off, or quits the game, the changes they have made still exist - unless another player reverts those changes.</div>
            <div>The second thing to know, and this is a big difference, is that Virtual Worlds have no <span class="win">win condition</span>. In a traditional game, there is a goal or task that - once completed - a winner is declared and the game ends. This means that Virtual Worlds are not 'true' games, as the game never ends and there is no winner. Instead, players find enjoyment from interacting with the setting or with other players.</div>
            <div>The third difference is that a user can interact with other players in real time. This can be a very basic interaction, such as chatting, but can also include more advanced features such as joining together to find treasure or fighting each other for control over territory. While many Virtual Worlds contain Player versus Player (PVP) combat, it is not a requirement. <a href="https://www.glitchthegame.com/">Glitch the Game</a> is an example of a Virtual World that had no combat at all.</div>
